The Optiness Project: Modeling retro games as implicit graphs since 2011.

Please see the documentation on the project's wiki:
https://github.com/chrismerck/Optiness/wiki

Note that there are currently some issues related to the recent API switch from
libsnes to libretro, but basic functionality should be back now.
